#include<stdio.h>
main()
	{
		printf("%-15.8s\n","embedded system");//in this case field width will reserve 15 no of empty spaces -ve field width represents it will justify towards the left hand side and the o/p should print <embedded> beacuse after . it gives 8 so we can print upto 8 digits only  

	}
